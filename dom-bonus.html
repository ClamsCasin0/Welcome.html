    DOM BONUS
    Create a list maker that confirms with the user if they wish to add an entry to a list.
        If the user confirms, after each new entry, prompt the user for additional
        items and then add them to the HTML of the page. If the user confirms not to add another
    item, end the cycle of user dialogue functions and apply styling to the page using JS only.
