        <!--<dt>Biscayne National Park, Florida.</dt>-->
            <!--<dd class="invisible">At the north end of the Florida Keys not too far from Miami, is a national park with four marine ecosystems - mangrove forest, the Bay, the Keys and coral reefs - that provide habitat for a diversity of wildlife, including threatened animals like the West Indian Manatee, American crocodile, sea turtles and peregrine falcon.  A female Schaus swallowtail butterfly was captured this summer, creating hope that this species may be able to return from the brink of extinction. In addition to wildlife watching, including snorkeling, visitors can boat, camp or fish. The Maritime Heritage Trail is the only underwater archaeological trail in the National Park System, just part of this place's catalog of the history of people who have resided here for the past 10,000 years.-->
        <!--</dd>-->
<!---->
        <!--<dt>Haleakala National Park, Hawaii</dt>-->
           <!--<dd class="invisible"> Maui's large volcanic crater known as Haleakalā is a place of legend. The point called Pōhaku Pālaha is sacred to Native Hawaiians, for whom this place remains "wao akua," or the wilderness of the gods. Rainforests provide refuge for many native Hawaiian plants and animals that exist nowhere else on the planet. The Kīpahulu Biological Reserve is so wild and precious that there is very limited access. This National Park has more endangered species than any other, as well as world-class night skies for watching planets, stars and moons. Visitors are welcome to camp under them, as well as to hike, backpack and swim in this breathtaking paradise.-->
           <!--</dd>-->
        <!--<dt> Gates of the Arctic National Park, Alaska</dt>-->
         <!--<dd class="invisible"> This national park is the farthest north, protecting a section of Alaska's Brooks Range, where people have lived for more than 13,000 years. Thousands of archeological sites demonstrate the strong ties between this land and its inhabitants, which today include Athapaskan and Inupiat descendants. The land remains pristine, especially since there are no facilities, roads or trails. But that shouldn't keep you from visiting. After all, arctic terns fly all the way from Antarctic waters to arrive here every year, the longest migration of any bird in the world. Those who join the tern will spy countless other birds and wildlife as they backpack, hike, camp and cruise the rivers.-->
        <!--</dd>-->
        <!--<dt>Mammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky </dt>-->
           <!--<dd class="invisible"> Well deserving of its name, Mammoth Cave National Park is by far the world's longest cave system, with 400 miles mapped underground. Treasures inside include gigantic cave formations ("niagara falls" pictured above), as well as 300-million-year-old fossils and perfectly preserved artifacts from natives who gathered minerals here 2-4,000 years ago. In addition to spelunking, visitors can explore 70 forested miles above ground by foot, bike or horse. The Green River winds through these lands as well, offering additional opportunities for boating, fishing and swimming.-->
        <!--</dd>-->
        <!--<dt>Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas</dt>-->
            <!--<dd class="invisible"> These natural hot springs have attracted visitors for centuries, causing a town to be created around them in the 1800s. Today it is the smallest National Park and the only one in an urban area. Its baths are managed for public use and also showcase the history of this practice. With 26 miles of trails, bathers can also hike or camp, or go for a relaxing scenic mountain drive.-->
        <!--</dd>-->
        <!--<dt> Channel Islands National Park, California</dt>-->
           <!--<dd class="invisible">Five of the eight Channel Islands and their surrounding waters are managed by the National Park Service, protecting this unique coastal Mediterranean ecosystem. Sometimes referred to as the "North American Galapagos", there are 145 animals and plants totally unique to this area, like the island fox. These islands are also home to the largest breeding colonies of seabirds in the region, as well as the oldest dated human remains on the continent. Painted Cave on Santa Cruz Island is one of the world’s largest known sea caves, with a length greater than four football fields. Nature lovers can choose from a plethora of outdoor recreation activities, including hiking, camping, snorkeling, fishing, surfing, as well as viewing birds, seals, sea lions and whales.-->
        <!--</dd>-->
        <!--<dt>Congaree National Park, South Carolina</dt>-->
           <!--<dd class="invisible">  Originally a national monument, this area became a International Biosphere Reserve and a Globally Important Bird Area before being designated as a National Park, the first and only in its state. Congaree National Park is primarily distinct because it is the largest tract of old-growth floodplain forest remaining in North America, and some of its trees are the tallest on its side of the continent. The Boardwalk Loop is an elevated walkway for visitors venturing through its swamps. Other fun activities here include hiking, camping, wildlife viewing, canoeing and kayaking.-->
        <!--</dd>-->
        <!--<dt>Capitol Reef National Park, Utah</dt>-->
           <!--<dd class="invisible">  Capitol Reef National Park features the stunning Waterpocket Fold, a 100-mile geologic monocline, which is like a wrinkle on the Earth that reveals its geologic layers. Other natural features are monoliths, sandstone domes, cliffs, canyons and bridges. In addition to its biological soil crusts, black boulders, stromatolite fossils, and tracks from the triassic era, this wild place has some of the best night sky viewing of all of the western national parks. Camping, hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, biking, horseback riding and scenic drives offer visitors all sorts of outdoor play.-->
           <!--</dd>-->
        <!--<dt> Big Bend National Park, Texas</dt>-->
           <!--<dd class="invisible"> They say everything in Texas is larger than average, and this place is no exception. Where the Rio Grande River makes its wide turn through the Chihuahuan Desert, a whole host of delight is revealed. This is a world-class geological area, with laccoliths, faults, volcanoes and remarkable fossils - including a world-record pterosaur and 50-foot crocodile. Ten-thousand-year-old archeological sites reveal a unique cultural history, and a diversity of wildlife make these wild lands a birder's paradise. Visitors can hike, fish, ride horseback, boat, go for a scenic drive, take a dip in a natural hot spring, or just lay back and take a marvelous gander at beautifully clear night skies - perhaps even seeing as far as two million light years away to the Andromeda galaxy!-->
           <!--</dd>-->
        <!--<dt> Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona</dt>-->
          <!--<dd class="invisible">  In the Painted Desert of Arizona, there is a collection of 225-million-year-old petrified wood that has become almost solid quartz. This section of the Chinle geological formation is known scientifically for its globally significant Late Triassic fossils. There are also over 350 Native American sites recording more than 13,000 years of human history and culture, as well as one of the most diverse collections of prehistoric pottery fragments in the Southwest. Over 52,000 acres of designated Wilderness provide spacious wild lands for hiking, backpacking, horseback riding and even geocaching.-->
